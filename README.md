# Recoil Demo

This project is a demonstration of the recoil library for state management in react.

## Getting Started

After installing with `yarn`, there is a remaining step in which you need to copy the `recoil` directory in the types folder in the root into your `@types` directory in the node modules.

The PR is pending for the `@types/recoil` package, so I had to add this manually.
